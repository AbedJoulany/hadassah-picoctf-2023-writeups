# Hints
Is there more code than what the inspector initially shows?

# Initial look
The above link brings you to a basic HTML page where there is a definition on includes, 
<br>and a button with text "say hello"

# How to solve it

first i read the text about the includes, then i clicked on the button and it showed this alert, that says the code is in a seperate file

so i opened the inspector then sources tab i found 3 files, index (html file), script.js and style.css
i looked to the js file and i found a function called greetings that alerts the message above and a commented line under f7w_2of2_b8f4b022},

then i opened the style.css.

And there was the flag but we can see that it's not completed,
since the alert says the code is in seperate files
and in the end of the flag is written 1 of 2, i understood that this is first part of the flag and the comment in the js is the second part.
<br>so i got the following flag: `picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_f7w_2of2_b8f4b022}`
