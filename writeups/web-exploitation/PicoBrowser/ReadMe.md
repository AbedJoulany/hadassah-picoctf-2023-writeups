##Hints
You don't need to download a new web browser

## Tools
To find the flag I used a virtual machine with Kali Linux Distribution

## Initial look
After Cliking the link you got a landing page

After cliking the big "FLAG" button there is an error saying<br/>
"You're not picobrowser! Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0"<br/>
so I understood that my browser ( firefox ) its the right one but need to be picobrowser<br/>

Using cli and curl cmd I change the user-agent with picobrowser name to get the source code of the url<br/>
