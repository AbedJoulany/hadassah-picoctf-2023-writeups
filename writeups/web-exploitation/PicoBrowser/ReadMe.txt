To find the flag I used a virtual machine with Kali Linux Distribution

1. The CTF asking you to check a link 
2. After Cliking the link you got a landing page ( ScreenShot : LandingPage link.png)
3. After cliking the big "FLAG" button there is an error saying
"You're not picobrowser! Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0"
so I understood that my browser ( firefox ) its the right one but need to be picobrowser
( ScreenShot : Error Page.png )
4. using cli and curl cmd I change the user-agent with picobrowser name to get the source code of the url

5.  After checking quickly i found the flag on the source code
