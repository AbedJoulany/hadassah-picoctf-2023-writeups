<p>This is the write-up for the challenge "logon" from picoCTF.</p>

<h1>The Challenge</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at?<p>

</p>
 
<h2>Hint</h2>
<p>Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for Joe's?</p>

<h2>Initial look</h2>
<p>The above link leads you to the factory login page, where you have to enter your username and password in order to sign in.</p>

<h1>How to solve it</h1>
<p>At first, I tried to enter to the site with "Joe" username and "logon" password, but unfortunately, it didn't work.
there was a message: "I'm sorry Joe's password is super secure. You're not getting in that way."</p>
<p>

 </p>
 
<p>Then, I looked at the hint: "Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for Joe's?", 
and I realized that only for the username "Joe" we have to know the correct password (because it is super-secure as the hint mentions), 
 but for anyone else other than him we don't have to know the password â€“ we can log in with that username and any arbitrary password we choose.</p>

<p>So I decided to log in as "admin" username with the password "admin", and I really managed to log in and enter the site.</p>
<p>But when I logged in I still didn't see any flag, I saw this message:</p>
<p>
<img width="446" alt="noFlag" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48062272/231998328-5521481b-2ec1-4e05-ac49-1a8a62138077.png">
</p>

 
<p>So I had to find a way to expose the flag. If it doesn't work only with the signing in, maybe it is related to some cookie of the website.
So I inspected the website, and looked at the cookies list:</p>
<p>

</p>
 
<p>I noticed that there is a cookie named "admin" and guessed that this cookie indicates 
  whether the username that is logged in to the site has admin permissions. 
  The initial value of the "admin" cookie was "False", and I wished to change it to "True" 
  in order to get the admin permissions and maybe see the flag as a result.</p>
<p>Luckily, this cookie is not HttpOnly and I was able to change its value manually.
  So I changed its value to "True", refreshed the page, and managed to find the flag value: 
  <b>picoCTF{th3_c0nsp1r4cy_l1v3s_d1c24fef}</b>  
  &#x1F601;</p>
