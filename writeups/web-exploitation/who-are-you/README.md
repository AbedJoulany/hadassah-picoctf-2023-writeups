The first thing I did was inspect everything I can in the site (F12), Entered the Network section and looked at the Response tab.<br/>
I found the response in there.<br/>
I also looked in the Headers tab and saw the Headers there.<br/>
![](images/screenshot3.jpg)

I searched a way to change Headers and found a tool called "Burp Suite", downloaded it and installed on my PC.<br/>
In the app I opened the Proxy tab, turned intercept on, and opened browser.<br/>

In the browser I opened the challenge link, the site wont fully load because intercept is on.<br/>
went back to Burp Suite, right clicked and sent to repeater. also turned intercept off.<br/>

Headed back to the Repeater section and pressed Send to get a response.<br/>

Changed the User-Agent Header to PicoBrowser and pressed Send again.<br/>
Got a different message now - "I don&#39;t trust users visiting from another site.".<br/>

Searched on google and found there is a Header called "Referer", changed it to the same link as the "Host" link.<br/>
Pressed Send and got a different message - "Sorry, this site only worked in 2018.".<br/>

Searched on google how to define date Header.<br/>
The template is like this: Date: <day-name>, <day> <month> <year> <hour>:<minute>:<second> GMT.<br/>
So I added the Header Date: Mon, 1 Jan 2018 01:01:01 GMT.<br/>
Pressed Send and got a new Response - "I don&#39;t trust users who can be tracked.".<br/>
![](images/screenshot9.jpg)  

Searched on google if there is a tracking Header.<br/>
Found there is a Header called DNT which means Do No Track. The options are 0 - allow tacking, 1 - disallow tracking or null.<br/>
So I added the Header and set the value to 1 and pressed Send, got a new Response - "This website is only for people from Sweden.".<br/>
![](images/screenshot10.jpg)  

Searched on google how to change the location. Found there is a Header called X-Forwarded-For.<br/>
Searched for a Swedish IP address. Added The header and the IP and pressed Send, and got a new Response - "You&#39;re in Sweden but you don&#39;t speak Swedish?".<br/>
![](images/screenshot11.jpg)
  
Searched on google what is the AcceptLanguage in Sweden, changed it to sv-sv and pressed Send, got a new Response - "What can I say except, you are welcome".<br/>
The site says - "picoCTF{http_h34d3rs_v3ry_c0Ol_much_w0w_0c0db339}".<br/>
