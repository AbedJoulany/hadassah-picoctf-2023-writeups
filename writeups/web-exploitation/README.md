About the riddle:
	The riddle's name is findme. The goal is to find the flag and submit it. How it works?
	You get a link to the opening screen, do a little research on it
	(why nothing happens when we enter the given username and password?),
	and by that you can find new hints by yourself(like base64 addresses) in addition to the "regular hint you receive. 
	
	Hint:
	“Any redirections?”
	
	Challenge description:
	There are given user name and password: the user name is test and the password is test!
	When I automatically entered the password and the username I reached to this page called "Welcome fellow Human". 
	
	Any kind of searching didn't help me at all and I got stacked in the same page. So I tried to do things differently and this is how it goes: 
	Because i wanted to understand how things are "behind the scenve" meaning what happends after we enter username and password 
	i press f12 to enter developer tools, than I pressed on “network tab” and then I 
	clicked “preserve logs” so it will log the logs when you log in. And then I entered 
	the same way again(with the given username test and password test!) and suddenly I saw new 2 given id’s
	 
	After I looked at the id’s it looked to me like base64 so I copied the first id and after that the second id and
	after i added  "==" it looked like a feet addrres in base64(I used the website https://www.base64decode.org/). when i tried to decode at first every 
	id seperately it didn't look like something i can work with so i secoded thwm together. 
	and only after i decoded thwm together i got the fit flag and subbmited it.
	 
	
	So i submitted the flag:    picoCTF{proxies_all_the_way_a0fe074f}
	 
	
	And then I received 100 points.
