I have looked at the hint.

First I started looking for hints in the page source, but I found nothing.<br/>
Then, i looked in sources(html and css) that are in inspect element, but i didnt find anything again.<br/>

I used the hint and the answer is: the creators dont want you to look in the robots.txt file.<br>
Traditionally search engines like google use webcrawler, they pull everything that is publicly availebale
in the index page. However some things you may not want to be indexed. I appended robots.txt and it showed me<br/>
the following format:
User-agent: *<br/>
Disallow: /8028f.html
<br/><br/>
I appended the /8028f.html to the url and i found the key.<br/>

The flag is: 'picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_8028f}'
