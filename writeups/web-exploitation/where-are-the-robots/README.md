## Hints
1. Access the webpage and try to match the regular expression associated with the text field

First I used the inspect element tool and looked at the HTML code.<br/>
I noticed there was a script tag there, I opened it and saw a fetch request to a server.<br/>
In the script there was a wierd comment "^p.....F!?", it reminded me a REGEX so I tried to match it in the input.<br/>
