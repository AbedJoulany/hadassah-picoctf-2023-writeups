<h1 style="font-size: 48px;">"basic-mod2" Challenge README</h1>
<h2 style="font-size: 20px;">Challenge Description</h2>
The "basic-mod2" challenge is a cryptography-based challenge that requires the user to decrypt a message.
The challenge provides a list of integers that represent the encrypted message. The user needs to perform certain calculations on each integer and map the resulting numbers to characters to get the decrypted message.

<h2 style="font-size: 20px;">Hint</h2>
1. Do you know what the modular inverse is?<br>
2. The inverse modulo z of x is the number, y that when multiplied by x is 1 modulo z.<br>
3. It's recommended to use a tool to find the modular inverses.
<h2 style="font-size: 20px;">Challenge Goals</h2>
The main goal of this challenge is to educate users about modular arithmetic and modular inverse in cryptography. 
The challenge aims to demonstrate how these concepts can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages securely.
<h2 style="font-size: 20px;">Challenge Instructions</h2>
Open the challenge website or access the encrypted message provided in the challenge.
Apply modular arithmetic and modular inverse operations on each integer in the encrypted message according to the instructions provided in the challenge.
Map the resulting numbers to their corresponding characters as described in the challenge statement to get the decrypted message.
Wrap the decrypted message in the picoCTF flag format (i.e. picoCTF{decrypted_message}).
<h2 style="font-size: 20px;">Challenge Solution</h2>
To solve this challenge, the user needs to perform modular inverse operations on each integer in the encrypted message modulo 41. 
The resulting numbers can be mapped to characters using a given character set to get the decrypted message.
The decrypted message is the flag for the challenge and should be wrapped in the picoCTF flag format.
<h2 style="font-size: 20px;">Conclusion</h2>
The "basic-mod2" challenge is a valuable learning tool for users to understand modular arithmetic and modular inverse in cryptography. 
It highlights the importance of these concepts in secure encryption and decryption of messages. 
In real-world scenarios, these concepts are used extensively in various cryptographic algorithms to ensure secure communication and data protection.
